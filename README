Random Scripts
==============

This is a collection of random scripts for random purposes that I've
needed to randomly do sometimes or something. Sometimes the scripts do a
thing. Sometimes they do multiple things. Sometimes they do things well,
sometimes they do things badly, and the basic idea is that they usually
did the thing I was set out to do for my personal purposes and that's
just about it. There's absolutely no guarantee that any of this stuff
is good for anything else.

License
-------

The files used to be under various random licenses (MIT, GPL, "do what the
hell you want and there's no warranty"), but I've now harmonised the
licenses so that all of this stuff is under the MIT license (even if
not explicitly stated as such). So I guess the same rules apply: Go nuts
with this, but there's no guarantee of any kind, let alone that this stuff
is in any way useful.
