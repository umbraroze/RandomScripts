# This script counts words in an org-mode file subtree. By default, it picks the
# first org-mode headline in the file, and counts words in all headings
# below it. Comments, empty lines and and headlines are ignored.
# To choose an alternate headline, specify it with -h (e.g. -h "Story").
# May be somewhat stupid and buggy and doesn't really take all org-mode
# markup into account at the moment.
